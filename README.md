- 👋 Hi, I’m @DinhJDev
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new technologies and implementing them in my own projects as well as increasing my employability.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, MERN, and Java stacks. But looking to master the Java full stacks, since that's what local employers seek.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any simple projects!
